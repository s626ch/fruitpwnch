# What does this project do?
fruitpwnch was built to combat people falling for scam messages on social networking platforms.<br/>
As of right now, it only works with [Discord](https://discord.gg/), and [Roblox](https://roblox.com/).<br/><br/>
In the future however, this project will work with:
- Twitter
- Facebook Messenger
- etc.

Soon, there will be the ability to restore a message.\*<br/><br/>
<i>(\*: This is not a high priority feature however.)</i>
