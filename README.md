# fruitpwnch-master
An extension to combat falling for scam messages on the web.

# What will this extension do?
Eventually, when this extension starts getting some functionality, it will be able to...
- Scan messages on multiple platforms (either with button, or automatically)
  - Discord
  - Twitter
  - Facebook Messenger
  - etc.
- Challenge message content against a list of known scam messages
- If the message loosely matches a known scam, remove the message from the page
- Give user the ability to unhide the message, if they want to

# What's this extension for?
This is being made as my capstone project for this school year.
